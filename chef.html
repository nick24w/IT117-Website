<p>Chef Mark has been in the kitchen all of his life, learning from his mother and other family members.  He developed a passion for cooking and went into the restaurant industry in the 90s starting as a preparation cook.</p>
<p>After realizing this is what is going to be his lifelong career he enrolled at Anne Arundel Community College for Culinary Arts.  He went on to become a Sous chef and ultimately a Head chef at a couple of Maryland restaurants. Owning his own restraurant has been a dream for years and which now has come true.</p>
