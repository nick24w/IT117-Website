<li>The idea for Dock on the Bay Bar & Grill started in the Summer of 2008.</li>
<li>Two friends who enjoy cooking together.</li>
<li>Founded by a love of creating an atmosphere and food everyone will enjoy.</li>
<li>Family friendly atmosphere.</li>
</ol>

<p>In the Summer of 2008, Mark and Nick were working together as the Executive and Sous chef of a restaurant local to them.  There they learned many things, and crafted ideas they would love to see.  Alas they learned their ideas wouldn't be able to come to life without their own restaurant.  That is where the whole journey began for Dock on the Bay Bar & Grill.</p>

<p>What began as a simple restaurant with a small indoor bar, quickly grew to a place that would be a place for everyone.  An indoor bar, an outdoor bar with a sandy fenced in play area for children, a dance floor and a dining room.  Numerous televisions for sports to be played, live music and karaoke for on the dance floor, a nice semi-formal yet casual dining room.</p>

<p>Their dreams have been brought to life with this restaurant. They want anyone and everyone to enjoy their time with us.  Whether it be the locals, drive in guests from out of town, or those who travel to the marina by boat.  So join them in whatever fun will be going on whether in your life or at our piece of paradise.</p>
